# Overview

This library provides easy-to-use Python modules for interacting with Acrome Robotics products.

# Modules 

## **Controller Module**

This module provides a hardware abstraction layer between Acrome Controller board and application code and enables users to develop their own applications without hassle of implementing a communication protocol or struggling with any timing requirements. This module also provides safety limitations for Acrome Robotics products and users don't have to worry about any mechanical or electrical limit of the products while working on their application code.

The controller module provides 6 different classes  for interacting with 5 different products and the Acrome Controller board itself.
